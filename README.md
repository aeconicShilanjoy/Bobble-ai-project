# Bobble-ai-project
This is the login page project assigned to us by Bobble ai for further process. 
As it was suggested to use Angular, Reactjs, etc I really do no have good idea about this I only have sound knowledge on HTML , CSS and Javascript, 
I am ready to learn any new Front end developement tool if required by the company, I am not complaining about the very short time I got to start with this project, I should have checked my mail today, I tried my best to build a login and signup page but due to time constraint its not exactly the same as the modular one as given in the email.
Any comments is appreciated.

The project can be viewed in Codepen :
